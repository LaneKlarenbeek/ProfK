                Some of my interests include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Music(singing):</li>
                    <p>I have enjoyed music for as long as I can remember, specifically singing.
                        Throughout all my years of school I have been a member of a choir, as well as participiting
                        in several honor choirs and South Dakota All-State Choir.
                        Music is a very important part of my life and every day I am learning new things and 
                        furthering my knowledge of the subject.
