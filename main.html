                    I grew up in a small town in South Dakota called Hudson. 
                    Being raised in a small town taught me a great amount about self-sustainability and 
                    hard work. I attended school in the Beresford School District, another small, tight-knit 
                    community similar to my own, and graduated in May of 2023. After graduating I moved on to 
                    Dakota State University to obtain a bachelor's degree in both Computer Science and 
                    Cyber Security. I am currently pursueing those degrees, and having so much fun in the process.
